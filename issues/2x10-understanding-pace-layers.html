                    <p>All the way back in the first issue of this year, I wrote about <a
                        href="https://botsandbeer.com/issues/2x00-freezing-your-branches-off">GitHub's Arctic Code Vault</a> in
                    what would truly be a turning point for this newsletter. That issue marked a future period of consistency
                    focused on a singular thematic approach that we've continued to this day. (Although I did have someone
                    unsubscribe recently saying I was too wordy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</p>
        
                    <p>A few days ago, I logged into <a href="https://github.com/szul">my GitHub account</a> and saw a little note
                        (what they're calling badges) under my profile. Hovering over it gave me:</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</p>
            
                            <p>Michael Szul contributed code to several repositories in the 2020 GitHub Archive Program: [...]</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>It was about as close to a surreal moment as when I first receive my Microsoft MVP Award. I <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/szul/status/1283838906715312128?s=20">joked on Twitter</a> that my code would
                        now outlive me, and hadn't yet figured out if that was a good or bad thing yet.</p>
            
                    <p>What GitHub is doing is hugely admirable, and there is no financial benefit to them doing this. They recently
                        announced the first deposit of code into the vault after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed trips to the Norway,
                        and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/github-arctic-vault-success-020240808.html">the tech press quickly
                            picked it up</a>.</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>GitHub's archive partner Piql wrote 21TB of repository data onto 186 reels of piqlFilm‚Äîa digital
                                photosensitive archival film that can be read by a computer, or a human with a magnifying glass.
                                [...] The service originally hoped to be done with the task by February, but it had to wait until it
                                was possible for the Piql team to travel to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, which only
                                recently re-opened its borders. It also had to drop its plans to send its own team to the Arctic.
                            </p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>Back when I first read about the GitHub Arctic Code Vault, it reminded me of a <a
                            href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/Home.html">Stewart Brand</a> project, and behold, as I read
                        further, the <a href="http://longnow.org">Long Now Foundation</a> (which Stewart Brand founded) was a
                        partner in the program. In fact, <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com">GitHub was clear on their usage
                            of Brand's concept of "pace layers</a>."</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
                            <p>We've adopted a "pace layers" strategy for archiving code, inspired by Long Now founder Steward
                                Brand. This approach is designed to maximize both flexibility and durability by providing a range of
                                storage solutions, from real-time to long-term storage. The Archive Program is partitioned into
                                three tiers: hot, warm, and cold.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>GitHub explains that they've divided their archiving strategy up into temperature zones ranging from near
                        real-time backups (such as GitHub's own data center backups) to monthly through yearly backups (such as with
                        the help of the Internet Archive), and finally backups that occur every 5 years or so (the Arctic Code Vault
                        being an example).</p>
            
                    <p>But what are pace layers?</p>
            
                    <p>According to Brand and futurist Paul Saffo, pace layers are a framework for thinking about the health of
                        society and how it functions. The idea originated in the <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/Clock-Long-Now-Time-Responsibility/dp/0465007805"><em>Clock of the Long
                                Now</em></a> book published over two decades ago. The idea centers on different functional layers
                        that work simultaneously, but at different speeds. In his original conception of the framework, Brand gave an
                        example of layers consisting of nature, culture, governance, infrastructure, commerce, and fashion (see the
                        image below).</p>
            
                    <p><img src="/static/images/2x10-int.jpg" alt="Pace Layering"></p>
            
                    <p>Pace layers <a href="https://everwas.com/2015/01/stewart-brand-and-the-pace-layer-model/">can be considered a
                            rubric</a> of sorts for describing how change occurs over the course of time.</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>Consider, for example, a coniferous forest. The hierarchy in scale of pine needle, tree crown, patch,
                                stand, whole forest, and biome is also a time hierarchy. The needle changes within a year, the tree
                                crown over several years, the patch over many decades, the stand over a couple of centuries, the
                                forest over a thousand years, and the biome over ten thousand years. The range of what the needle
                                may do is constrained by the tree crown, which is constrained by the patch and stand, which are
                                controlled by the forest, which is controlled by the biome. Nevertheless, innovation percolates
                                throughout the system via evolutionary competition among lineages of individual trees dealing with
                                the stresses of crowding, parasites, predation, and weather.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>Brand has previously given other examples in his talks. For example, consider your home, and the rate of
                        change of the construction site, the house, the paint on the outside, the paint on the inside, the furniture,
                        and <a href="https://youtu.be/MvgN5gCuLac">all of your stuff</a>. Those different components clearly change
                        at different rates.</p>
            
                    <p>Pace layers are functionally different from each other and often act in an independent manner, but they are
                        not disconnected from each other. There is an influence between them‚Äîa certain interplay.</p>
            
                    <p>To Brand, pace layers can act as filters between layers, but the most important aspect of the pace layers are
                        the so-called "slip zones"‚Äîwhere the layers meet. This is where the conflict between layers occurs, and as a
                        result, these layers begin to influence one another, pushing and pulling at their different paces.</p>
            
                    <p>Sometimes, this tension between layers becomes too much. Brand terms this "slippage," and the result is a
                        faulty system. To Brand, healthy systems are able to absorb shock from movement at their own pace, but
                        unhealthy systems experience slippage causing layers to damage, and disrupting the system as a whole. Brian
                        Eno posits that those civilizations that have a focused "long now" are more likely to have a flexible
                        infrastructure that can absorb shocks from the tension between layers. We see this in history as culture and
                        governance are always in a dance of change, but if governance cannot keep up with culture shifts, that
                        government can fall, and in its last throws, it can cause significant harm and damage to culture, society,
                        and nature.</p>
            
                    <p><a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand">This isn't a unique thought</a> by Brand or Eno:</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>In recent years a few scientists [...] have been probing the same issue in ecological systems: how do
                                they manage change, how do they absorb and incorporate shocks? The answer appears to lie in the
                                relationship between components in a system that have different change-rates and different scales of
                                size.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>Furthermore, Brand quotes Freeman Dyson in his original paper on the topic:</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>The destiny of our species is shaped by the imperatives of survival on six distinct time scales. To
                                survive means to compete successfully on all six time scales. But the unit of survival is different
                                at each of the six time scales. On a time scale of years, the unit is the individual. On a time
                                scale of decades, the unit is the family. On a time scale of centuries, the unit is the tribe or
                                nation. On a time scale of millennia, the unit is the culture. On a time scale of tens of millennia,
                                the unit is the species. On a time scale of eons, the unit is the whole web of life on our planet.
                                Every human being is the product of adaptation to the demands of all six time scales. That is why
                                conflicting loyalties are deep in our nature. In order to survive, we have needed to be loyal to
                                ourselves, to our families, to our tribes, to our cultures, to our species, to our planet. If our
                                psychological impulses are complicated, it is because they were shaped by complicated and
                                conflicting demands.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>Some elements in society transcend layers, impacting many or all at once. Technology is once such element
                        where&amp;,dash;if we're using Brand's example from the image above‚Äîit permeates every area from fashion to
                        commerce to governance and so on. To Brand, technology is like gravity, while other elements like democracy
                        act as catalysts.</p>
            
                    <p>The key concept that you can pull out of the theory of pace layers is the observation of speed between the
                        layers. Outer layers are faster, but the layers get progressively slower as you travel towards the inner
                        layers. To Brand: "Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power." Speed, however, is also correlated
                        with quantity, so the outer layers are often more abundant than the inner layers as well. Brand believes
                        that the "paced" variety between layers acts as a stabilizing force for the system as a whole, often
                        preventing destabilizing positive-feedback loops that are looking to crash the system that the layers make
                        up.</p>
            
                    <blockquote>
            
                            <p>The total effect of the pace layers is that they provide a many-leveled corrective, stabilizing
                                feedback throughout the system. It is precisely in the apparent contradictions between the pace
                                layers that civilization finds its surest health.</p>
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p>We have to remember that a "system"‚Äîso to speak‚Äî is an interconnected set of elements organized in a manner
                        that accomplishes a purpose. The excellent <a href="http://donellameadows.org">Donella Meadows</a> noted
                        that a system requires three key attributes to exist: elements, interconnectedness, and purpose. With pace
                        layers, the different layers represent the elements involved in the system, while the interconnectedness is
                        where the layers touch and influence one another. Meanwhile, each individual pace layer diagram that
                        represents a system, must attempt to achieve a clear purpose.</p>
            
                    <p><em>We'll cover systems thinking in a future issue of this newsletter.</em></p>
            
                    <p>If we return to GitHub's implementation of pace layers, you can see that each of their elements or layers is
                        a form of archiving that is moving at different speeds:</p>

                    <p>Each of these archiving mechanisms act independently but the technology driving them transcends the layers and
                        allows them to interact with one another by adjusting the technology, speed, and availability of the
                        archiving. Each layer is also created with a different purpose: The inner layers are meant mostly for
                        real-time access and development, while the outer layers are more for disaster recovery, long-term strategy,
                        learning, and civilization preservation. As you move farther and farther to the other layers, the need
                        shifts from the "now" of immediate source control and towards the "long now" of <em>code as history</em>.

                    <p>Although this might not be as attention-grabbing as a pace layer system about humanity and culture as a
                        whole, this microcosmic look at layering shows us how companies built for the better good can implement this
                        strategy to shift from the regular pace of today's financially extractive economies to a long view of the
                        needs of society, as well as the niche that those individual companies fill.</p>
            
                    <p>Throughout writing this, I keep meditating on Brand's key takeaway: <em>Fast gets all our attention, slow has
                            all the power.</em> Looking at society today, we have the meme-heavy social media algorithms pushing
                        headlines for biased opinion articles where people don't even read the article or fact-check it; They just
                        read the headlines, agree, and share. We have an economic system that forgets that <em>eco-nomy</em> and
                        <em>eco-logy</em> come from the same root word; The latter being <em>the study of the house</em> and the
                        former being <em>the management of the house</em>‚Äîan economy obsessed with quarter-to-quarter growth and
                        upwards financial extraction at all costs. And of course, we have a viral pandemic spreading faster than
                        anyone would have imagined.</p>
            
                    <p>My hope is that these are loose, outer layers gathering all the attention for our current "moment," but that
                        the power lies in the long-term thinking that is starting to permeate our society‚Äîmainly championed by
                        people of color who are most affected by the inequality, racism, and climate pain brought on by the current
                        trends in our faster layers.</p>

                    <p>You ever get random tweets of beer? Apparently, I do, and this one comes from Codepunk co-host and Bots +
                        Beer co-contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/neurothustra">Bill Ahern</a>‚Äîabout to settle down for a
                        night of horror movies and milk stouts (except for the Founders). Those who actually read this far down the
                        newsletter, know how we feel about Founders, which is a staple of any great beer fridge (especially the
                        CBS‚ÄîCanadian Breakfast Stout). I'm most interested in the mint chocolate chip milk stout on the right‚Äîsounds
                        like dessert, and the art on the can reminds me of a good horror movie.</p>
            
                    <p>Which horror movie was Bill enjoying? <em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter</em>‚Äîwhat looked originally to
                        be the final installment of the Crystal Lake slasher franchise and featured a young Corey Feldman. From a
                        technology perspective, this fourth chapter centered on the idea of masks (pretty important today, huh?),
                        and featured some great scenes of Halloween style masks created by Feldman's onscreen character. As a child
                        of the 80's, seeing this process onscreen was actually a revelation, and there is something aesthetically
                        pleasing about the use and evolution of makeup and artist effects as opposed to CGI. Maybe it's just my
                        nostalgia.</p>
