                    <p>I struggled to find a good title for this issue. I'm pulling together a handful of concepts, philosophies,
                        and recent events to contemplate how technology impacts other parts of our society, and sometimes that
                        cross-contemplation prevents a quippy title.</p>
                
                    <p>If you <a href="https://twitter.com/szul">follow me on Twitter</a>, you know that <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/szul/status/1208413716821282816">I did a recent rant</a> on supporting
                        creatives, whether that means open source software developers on GitHub Sponsors, or chefs and writers (and
                        craft beer magazines) on Patreon. One of the people I follow and support is journalist and writer <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/AdamRRowe">Adam Rowe</a>, who <a href="https://twitter.com/70sscifi">has a
                            great Twitter account</a> about early era science fiction art. One of Adam's recent posts centered on
                        the cover art to Ursula K. Le Guin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness"><em>Left
                                Hand of Darkness</em></a>. For
                        those that don't know, Le Guin was a pioneer of early science fiction, and helped to break many barriers
                        getting sci-fi accepted by the mainstream. This isn't the first time in the past 12 months that Le Guin has
                        returned to the limelight: <a href="http://longnow.org/">The Long Now Foundation</a> (mentioned in our <a
                            href="https://botsandbeer.com/issues/2x00-freezing-your-branches-off">previous issue</a>) had <a
                            href="https://theinterval.org/salon-talks/02018/nov/13/learning-from-ursula-le-guin-robinson-ksr">an
                            Interval salon talk</a> with author Kim Stanley Robinson (from <em>Mars Trilogy</em> fame), who spoke
                        about his relationship with Le Guin, and her influence on the genre.</p>
                
                    <p>Drawing more connecting lines between Rowe and Robinson's foray into Le Guin's domain: Both Rowe's
                        post and Robinson's talk take a deep look at the <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em>‚Äîa novel especially
                        notable for having a utopian portrayal of an anarchist society. The intrigue here is that when we think of
                        anarchy, we don't often think about a society prospering.</p>
                
                    <p>Star Trek is one of my all-time favorite universes because it explores what life would be like in the far
                        future with humanity's one mission to explore the unknown. The Federation is a loose United Nations, but
                        rarely does Star Trek discuss the economy or government. We know that "money" in the most general sense has
                        been eliminated as a form of greed, and abundance is common‚Äîpoverty is a thing of the past. Many take Star
                        Trek to represent a close-to-utopia socialist society, but others would argue that it's a "post-money"
                        society with a <a href="https://thenextsystem.org/participatory-economics-and-the-next-system">participatory
                            economic system</a>.</p>
                
                    <p>In a world where scarcity is a thing of the past, can capitalism work? Can democracy? <a

                        abundance, so competition was satisfied via academic achievement and Federation rank. Reputation, after all,
                        was not in abundance.</p>

                        constantly bombarded with articles about how automation and artificial intelligence are going to reduce the

                    <p>The Vox article is short on the answers from some of the other top candidates, but without even looking you
                        can be assured that they all followed a similar theme of trying to ram automation into our current economic
                        and democratic processes‚Äîwalking the line between ensuring innovation that creates more capital for
                        corporations and finding talking-points for how the everyday, blue-collar worker will be helped. Only Yang's
                        answer has some indication of societal transformation.</p>
                
                    <p>But what if we're wrong? If we can automate 50% of the jobs out there, shouldn't we want to? Then we could
                        spend our time on things we actually enjoy doing, right? Douglas Rushkoff wrote in a <a
                            href="https://rushkoff.com/cnn-com-are-jobs-obsolete/">CNN article years ago</a> that:</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                
                        <p>"I am afraid to even ask this, but since when is unemployment really a problem? I understand we all
                            want paychecks ‚Äî or at least money. We want food, shelter, clothing, and all the things that money
                            buys us. But do we all really want jobs?"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                
                    <p>All of this potential job loss is hypothetical though. Let's circle back to the modern year of 2020 and look
                        at another technology-related innovation hurting the everyday worker: The gig economy.</p>
                
                    <p>The so-called gig economy was supposed to allow freelancers, and others in need of petty cash, to do a
                        handful of jobs when they wanted (or needed) to. This didn't stop with freelance designing or coding, but
                        continued to describe jobs from Uber, Lyft, AirBnb, GrubHub, etc.. The problem? Many people who see
                        themselves as Uber drivers are devoid of healthcare, and have none of the protections that cab driver unions
                        offer. Meanwhile, Uber is heavily eating away at the cab business. Uber has essentially used contract worker
                        status to avoid paying for the normal protections and benefits that would be received by a full-time
                        employee. This means that while the gig economy flourishes, and increases the revenue and capital of
                        companies that rely on this model, the workers themselves tend to suffer.</p>
                
                    <p>California has attempted to rectify this with bill <a
                            href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-california-employment-law-going-effect-2020">AB
                            5</a>, which <a
                            href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-30/uber-postmates-call-ab5-unconstitutional-new-lawsuit">is
                            already being contested in court</a>. This bill forces companies reliant on gig workers to pass a "sniff
                        test" to determine if those workers truly are independent.</p>
                
                    <p>Uber is not short on despicable business practices, but is the gig economy that they subscribe to a problem?
                        Or is it only a problem because of our current societal norms when it comes to commerce, employment, and
                        regulation?</p>
                
                    <p>Ben Thompson <a
                            href="https://stratechery.com/2019/ab-5-and-health-care-project-connected-home-over-ip-ecosystem-pragmatism/">holds
                            no punches about this</a> in his newsletter when discussing AB 5, Uber, and things like healthcare,
                        including a quote back to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/dont-blame-uber/">a previous assessment</a>:
                    </p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                
                        <p>Beyond the lack of regard for consumers, the truth is the venom is misplaced: it's not that Uber is
                            bad for not hiring workers and giving them attendant benefits, it‚Äôs that said benefits shouldn't be
                            Uber's‚Äîor any employer's ‚Äî responsibility at all. It's employer-based health care that is the
                            problem, and in ways that go beyond the economic benefits of universal health care (the most obvious
                            of which is the broadest possible risk pool, not to mention unmatched buying power). It‚Äôs that
                            people are afraid to leave or lose their jobs because they lack the most basic of safety nets.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                
                    <p>What Ben is talking about is a fundamental shift in the way we view "benefits"‚Äîsomething that hasn't changed
                        much since employee benefits actually became a thing. Connect this with our original topic of the way that
                        AI is expected to fundamentally change the economic landspace because of automation, and you're looking at a
                        future where abundance is widespread, but menial jobs aren't needed, and many companies are providing
                        task-based jobs. Trying to shoehorn this into our current corporatist economy will not work, and it has some
                        fundamental challenges with capitalism‚Äîespecially the extractive capitalism that private equity and the
                        financial industry is currently pioneering.</p>
                
                    <p>So what does the future look like? Unfortunately‚Äîoutside of Star Trek‚Äîmost of our visions of the future are
                        dystopian, and any of our speculation on alternatives to capitalism and democracy are incapable of imagining
                        a functioning, prosperous society. This is why science fiction like Le Guin's <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em>
                        are important. They allow us to imagine alternative visions that can help up shape our own future in lieu of
                        circumstances of the present. It's easy to look at our current use of technology and only see the darkness
                        in surveillance, data collection, automation, and artificial intelligence in light of our massive
                        mega-corporations and wealthy politicians, and see only despair, but as <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/neurothustra">Bill</a> often says, our technology seems to evolve faster than
                        our morality; Once that morality catches up, we see changes in business and government that reflect this new
                        moral outlook. In fact, we're starting to see some of that now with climate change, despite the current
                        Presidential administration's stance on green policy. I imagine that the same will happen with the effects
                        of automation and the changes that the gig economy has brought us. </p>

                    <p>Despite being a fan of craft beer, I'm not largely familiar with beer from outside of the United States. I
                        can't tell you if Woodpecker is the best Indian beer (or even considered a good one), but it was one of four
                        served at Taj of India in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The taste is similar to a German Pilsner, but doesn't
                        carry as much funk as some grain-heavy beer. Despite a 6.5% ABV label, it was a smooth, drinkable beer that
                        paired nicely with the curried dishes we ordered.</p>
