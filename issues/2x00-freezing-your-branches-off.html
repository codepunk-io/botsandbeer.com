                    <p><em>Welcome to 2020! We've tweaked the design of this newsletter a little more starting with this issue.
                        Respond to this email if you like it, have suggestions, or prefer the older format. All back issues are
                        slowly being converted to the new design and published on the <a href="https://botsandbeer.com">Bots +
                            Beer</a> web site.</em></p>
                
                    <p>In <a href="https://codepunk.io/codepunk-054-github-artic-code-vault/">the last episode of Codepunk for
                            2019</a>, we did an extended dive into the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com">GitHub Arctic
                            Code Vault</a> and their whole archiving initiative. Normally, I don't like to repeat content from one
                        format into another, but this newsletter does allow for some additional rumination on certain off-the-cut
                        commentary from the podcast. Also... I <em>really</em> like this initiative because it blends a few of my
                        passions: open source programming, long-term thinking, and historical archiving. I was a horder of books for
                        a significant period of my life.</p>
                    
                    <p>I mentioned in the podcast that I went on a bit of a guerilla archiving tear after Donald Trump won the U.S.
                        election. Leaving politics aside, the Trump administration and the conservative party certainly had an
                        inclination to de-emphasize climate change information and research. In my paranoid state, I downloaded and
                        archived <a href="https://archive.org/details/nasa_open_access_october_codes">all of the Nasa PMC research
                            that dealt with climate change</a>, and posted it to the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet
                            Archive</a> and <a href="https://october.codes/library/research/nasa-pmc-mirror">other</a> sources. It
                        wasn't long after doing this that I <a

                        of a trend, if not a valiant cause.</p>

                            Stanford University, and California Digital Library, among other libraries, and is designed to serve
                            as a permanent record of government-related communications during presidential transitions.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the immediate concerns of one person's (or one administration's) desire to reduce focus on a
                        particular subject (this research was never going to actually go away), as human beings, we have a
                        significant amount of paranoia when to comes to <a
                            href="https://ehistory.osu.edu/articles/burning-library-alexandria">losing knowledge</a>, and a great

                    <p>The <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com">GitHub Arctic Code Vault</a> is more than an archiving
                        initiative. There is an aesthetic appeal to it that fits more in line with the lofty philosophy of the San
                        Francisco-area non-profit it's partnered with: <a href="http://longnow.org">The Long Now Foundation</a>. The
                        code vault's home page is plastered with a beautiful arctic backdrop, while a countdown clock ticks away the
                        seconds until the first code deposit‚Äîan emphasis on time. This is more than a Big Tech initiative. Read
                        this:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                    
                        <p>Future historians will be able to learn about us from open source projects and metadata. They might
                            regard our age of open source ubiquity, volunteer communities, and Moore's Law as historically
                            significant.</p>

                    <p>That's not a statement that's talking about 10, 50, or even 100 years into the future. What about this
                        statement:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                    
                        <p>The introduction to the archive will include technical guides to QR decoding, file formats, character
                            encodings, and other critical metadata so that the raw data can be converted back into source code
                            for use by others in the future. The archive will also include a Tech Tree‚Äîa roadmap and Rosetta
                            Stone for future curious minds inheriting the archive's data.</p>

                    <p>On the aforementioned podcast episode, I mentioned that I felt the very inclusion of "Rosetta Stone"
                        (although it wouldn't be all that uncommon) made me wonder how much influence Steward Brand of the Long Now
                        Foundation had in the creation of this program.</p>
                    
                    <p>The importance of the <a
                            href="https://blog.britishmuseum.org/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-rosetta-stone/">Rosetta
                            Stone</a> to human history is rarely understated, but because it's such a well known artifact, we can
                        often hear its name without contemplating it's importance. That importance is immense: Scholars had no idea
                        how to read Egyptian hieroglyphics before the Rosetta Stone. It opened an entire line of inquiry into
                        Ancient Egyptian culture and language‚Äîa boon to historians and linguists alike.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Long Now Foundation has it's own <a href="http://rosettaproject.org">Rosetta Stone</a> project:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                    
                        <p>The Rosetta Project is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to
                            build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>The Rosetta Project is a collection of initiatives that includes its very own artifact‚Äîa disk containing the
                        same texts written in over a thousands languages. The Long Now Foundation considers it a decoder ring of
                        sorts meant to catalog the languages of the world in a way that prevents the languages from dying.</p>
                    
                    <p>From the Rosetta Project's information page:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                    
                        <p>Our first prototype of a very long-term archive is The Rosetta Disk - a three inch diameter nickel
                            disk with nearly 14,000 pages of information microscopically etched onto its surface. Since each
                            page is an image, rather than a digital encoding of 1's and 0's, it can be read by the human eye
                            using 500 power optical magnification.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>The Rosetta Project has placed a significant focus on preserving language with several different projects,
                        and I often look at programming as an extension of linguistics‚Äîspecial languages capable of world-building
                        beyond storytelling; Languages that communicate in poetry and art disguised as science. To me, GitHub's
                        archiving initiative is a natural extension of language and art preservation. The Long Now Foundation looks
                        holistically at their projects‚Äîdeveloping a story and aesthetic to solidify the value of the project in the
                        eyes of its donors. They're creating sacredness as a way to propel scientific endeavor by treating the long
                        now of humanity as a living myth to shape. GitHub is following suit.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you land on the GitHub Arctic Code Vault home page, you're treated with spectacle on par with the Long
                        Now's work, so it makes sense that the two (as well as others) are partners in this project. If you doubt
                        that spectacle, take a look at their <a href="https://youtu.be/fzI9FNjXQ0o">YouTube video</a> and tell me
                        they aren't aiming for the dramatic. A significant amount of effort went into that mini-documentary for a
                        project that you and I won't benefit from, but people 10,000 years from now might.</p>

                    <h4 class="row-heading first">Hardywood Christmas Pancakes</h4>
                    <p>It's a sad month. Hardywood has a pilot brewery in Charlottesville, VA where I work (yes, that
                        Charlottesville), but unfortunately they are closing it down this month to move it to another facility in
                        Richmond two hours away. Hardywood has some of my favorites in their Reserve Series. You could drink
                        Christmas Pancakes for breakfast; It is very close to its namesake. Not as potent as the Kentucky Christmas
                        Morning mentioned in the previous Bots + Beer issue, but highly enjoyable and light feeling for a stout.</p>
