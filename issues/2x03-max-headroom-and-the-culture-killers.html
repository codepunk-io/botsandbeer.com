                    <p><em>Fair warning for regular readers: Some of this issue was available in a brief email sent to limited
                        subscribers after <a href="https://codepunk.io/codepunk-048-the-subversiveness-of-max-headroom/">our Max
                            Headroom podcast episode</a>. I apologize for the repeat of some material, but wanted to work it
                        into a longer analysis.</em></p>
        
                    <p>Some of you signed up for this newsletter after our Facebook deep dive. Now you have to sit through me
                        analyzing an 80's sci-fi character. Sorry. But stick with me, we get into economic trials towards the end.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>Re-reading the title of this issue, I realize that <em>Max Headroom and the Culture Killers</em> sounds like
                        a band name. That's actually fitting since the focus of this issue in part centers on how financial
                        extraction has killed innovative, quality art, especially in the music (and entertainment) industry. But
                        what does that actually have to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_(character">Max
                            Headroom</a>), and why I am insisting on bringing up a spokesperson from a terrible Coca-Cola marketing
                        era?</p>
            
                    <p>If you didn't grow up in the 80's or very early 90's and only live off of memes, YouTube video clips, and
                        recycled collage advertisements that feign nostalgia, you might recognize Max Headroom as a goofy head in a
                        television box with an annoying stutter and bad fashion sense.</p>
            
                    <p>I'm here to tell you that you're wrong... and not job your taste is fashion either.</p>
            
                    <p>Now stop reading this email, and go listen to our Max Headroom podcast episode real quick.</p>
            
                    <p>Done? Good.</p>
            
                    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/szul">Bill</a> was itching to do a Max Headroom episode, and was curious about
                        the lack of a reboot, or even the hint of a revival consider our current obsession with 80's nostalgia. Max
                        himself (itself?) was a highly experimental creation that blended music, artificial intelligence, and
                        cyberpunk, and the end result was much more subversive than any of us remember thanks to New Coke
                        commercials perverting our perceptions. But let's make a note of a few things:</p>
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>The original Max Headroom pilot was less than an hour of grainy made-for-TV goodness meant
                                to launch Max as a video DJ for a UK music video show</li>
                        <li>The network on the show is Network 23, and we all known <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_enigma">the counterculture significance</a> of that
                                number.</li>
                        <li>The apartment they raid at the very beginning is apartment 42‚Äî<a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number">the meaning of life</a> according to Douglas
                                Adams, and if you read around the rest of that Wikipedia link, so can see the significance it has
                                with Lewis Carroll and others as well.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p>From the beginning, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZY-yQYVf38"><em>Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into
                                the Future</em></a> had its geek credentials in order, and gave us a glimpse of a dystopian future
                        where people are treated as nothing more than data, media dominates the landscape, and society is
                        manipulated for corporate gain.</p>
            
                    <p>Sound familiar?</p>
            
                    <p>But this <em>is</em> a television movie we're talking about, and it <em>was</em> meant to introduce and
                        spin-off a video disc jockey, so Max Headroom eventually escapes into the datastream with a couple of
                        cyberpunk music heads running a pirate radio station: The implication being that even though the free love
                        of the hippie era left us short of truly being free, the cyberpunks now controlled cyberia, and the new
                        submersive music that your parents hated would be shots of Jaeger for the soul (chicken soup need not
                        apply).</p>
            
                    <p>I'm old enough to remember when MTV had music. Scratch that. I'm old enough to remember when MTV began. I'm
                        not <em>that</em> old. (I think I was 2 when they launched). But I <em>am</em> old enough to remember MTV as
                        a pioneer of the counterculture, spinning audio-visual pleasures that put pictures to the subversive music
                        you only heard on vinyl.</p>
            
                    <p>When MTV began it started with images of the Apollo moon landing‚Äîideas of the future of humanity‚Äîplaying to
                        rock music. The first music video was <em>Video Killed the Radio Star</em>‚Äîhumanity transitioning through
                        technology. MTV drove sales of albums that weren't getting radio play, altering the landscape of music and
                        culture. As rock music transitioned in the 80's, MTV was there. MTV allowed for the 80's pop/experimental to
                        rise as a paradigm of futuristic philosophy, one-hit wonders, and commentary on the very consumerism it was
                        pushing. During the 90's, it was a place to find alternative music that wasn't widely popular in car radios.
                        Would Nirvana and the grunge movement of teenage angst even have been a thing without the video for
                        <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em>?</p>
            
                    <p>MTV VJs weren't television personalities like Carson Daly. Kurt Loder was a Rolling Stones journalist before
                        joining the company. Kennedy went on to become a host of several Fox Broadcasting shows. Both Loder and
                        Kennedy describe themselves as libertarian, but much more in the left-libertarian tradition of the original
                        computer underground. Kennedy‚Äîa Nixon evangelist‚Äîleaned a little more conservative until eventually giving
                        up on social conservatism, even officiating the gay wedding of friends. Kennedy's politics might be most
                        famous for chanting "Nixon now" during an MTV event for the Clintons. But remember, this was during a time
                        when young people were highly skeptical of government in general.</p>
            
                    <p>What about Tabitha Soren? At 19 years old she was in the Beastie Boys video about fighting against the
                        oppression of your parents in order to live freely. She then embarked on an MTV career introducing teenagers
                        and young adults to the importance of politics and voting‚Äîinterviewing presidents, leaders, important
                        political figures, and winning awards along the way.</p>
            
                    <p>Even the most commericialized personality at the time‚ÄîDowntown Julie Brown‚Äêhad a sizable impact on culture as
                        a mixed-race UK import who turned an on-air mistake into a catch-phrase. This is a company that launch Pauly
                        Shore into the stratosphere by cultivating his surfer-bro party alter-ego during a time when America was
                        transitioning out of the experimental 80's, forgetting it's Vietnam War sins, and was entering into economic
                        recovery. Shore was also a performance comedian whose parents owned the Comedy Store where he opened for Sam
                        Kinison. Not exactly "commercial."</p>
            
                    <p>Today, MTV is a pale shell of what once powered the collective, subversive mindshare of America's youth.</p>
            
                    <p>Drew Austin has an excellent newsletter called <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com">The Kneeling
                            Bus</a>, and in one of his issues, he quotes Richard Meltzer who noted that rock-and-roll had value
                        until it was everywhere‚Äîthis idea that scarcity breeds contemplation, which breeds catharsis. Radio made
                        music readily available, but still on rotation. Want the song? Buy the album. As technology progressed and
                        the tape deck emerged, you could record off the radio in lieu of buying the whole album. Nowadays, you can
                        just buy songs individually, or stream them whenever you want. Artists who painstakingly crafted everything
                        from the music, the song order, the album cover art, the lyric sheets, and the videos that expanded the
                        message they wanted to convey have been replaced by immediate, single consumption.</p>
            
                    <p>Largely this is the result of our financially extractive economy. Large corporations dominate the music (and
                        overall entertainment) industry, looking to execute on the mythic algorithm to create the most viral pop
                        song. The demand from shareholders is for financial growth, so corporations are looking the spend the least
                        for the greatest return on investment. This why the movie industry invests so heavily in sequels, and if not
                        sequels, the movies follow a formulaic approach devoid of a soul. Music is no different, and all of the
                        major music companies invest mostly in the formulaic pop music that rotates on the radio and YouTube.
                        Originality is gone. Messaging is gone. The very emotional, carthartic, and transformative origins of music
                        have been completely stripped out‚Äîeliminating the value of storytelling‚Äîleaving us with Billboard charts of
                        clones that can be converted to data, measured, and duplicated for financial growth.</p>
            
                    <p>This is the very dystopian future that Max Headroom implied‚Äîpeople as data. The subversiveness of music and
                        music videos was the 80's answer, but that fell once corporations found a way to absorb and commericialize
                        the salient talking points of the counterculture.</p>
            
                    <p>Despite the odd foray into Coca-Cola spokesmanship, the craziest part of Max Headroom's legacy might be the
                        <a href="https://hackcur.io/the-max-headroom-incident-the-greatest-unsolved-mystery-in-pirate-television/">Chicago
                            television hacks</a> in 1987. With no engineers on duty, a hacker was able to place an antenna dish
                        between the transmitter tower and the transmission. The hacker was never caught.</p>
            
                    <p>The signal intrusion actually occurred twice for short bursts, and the videos were chaotic and a bit creepy.
                        The hacker wore a Max Headroom mask, and clearly wasn't sure what to do with his or her newly discovered
                        power, but the disorganization of the hacks made it all the more interesting.</p>
            
                    <p>There was some speculation about who the hacker might have been, but no definitive evidence was ever
                        acquired. The FCC was, however, able to determine the location where the videos might have been recorded
                        because of visual clues in the material.</p>
            
                    <p>In my opinion, using a Max Headroom mask would be far more appropriate for hacktivism than a V for Vendetta
                        one, but I guess just like the commercialization of our music, or hacking has to be a commercialized,
                        attention-grabbing, pop culture sound bite as well.</p>
                        
                    <p class="center"><img src="/static/images/2x03-02.jpg" alt="New Coke" title="New Coke" /></p>
                    <h4 class="row-heading first">New Coke</h4>
                    <p>Thanks to Stranger Things and 80's nostalgia, it looks like Coca-Cola is actually selling some New Coke (or
                        was) as part of a promotional campaign for the Netflix show. It was some interesting synchronicity that I
                        found out about 2 days after we launched the Max Headroom episode, and being a sucker, I ordered a pack. It
                        was interesting to once again taste the difference between the two cola formulations. Yes, New Coke was
                        sweeter, but soda is soda, and none of us should be drinking it anyway. The taste certainly wasn't different
                        enough to justify the uproar Coke experienced at the time. If you can get your hands on some, do yourself a
                        favor and try it. Consider it the official taste of this issue. And if you're disappointed that no alcohol
                        made it's way into this issue, feel free to mix the New Coke with some high quality rum.</p>
