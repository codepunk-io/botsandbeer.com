                        Is everyone hanging in there?</p>

                    <p>
                        There's been a lot of talk about working remotely and the future of remote work lately, and I don't want
                        to feel like I'm piling on the trendy bandwagon by repeating a lot of the same information, so this email
                        will focus on both the approach-ability of remote work, and dive deeper into what makes remote work
                        possible&mdash;both from a technological and a philosophical standpoint&mdash;and what the future might truly
                        hold.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Culture Change</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        In dipping into the often quoted William Gibson phrase of the even distribution of the future, let's quickly
                        acknowledge that some company's are more equipped for remote work than others. <a
                            href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/2/21162240/twitter-coronavirus-headquarters-employees-work-from-home">It's
                            easy for some company's to declare an edict of everyone working from home</a>‚Äêespecially in the
                        technology industry&mdash;but that's not the case with many.</p>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisherd/">Chris Herd</a> had <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/companies-who-adopt-remote-work-replace-every-company-chris-herd/">a
                            good article on LinkedIn</a> discussing the benefits of work-from-home relationships when it comes to talent
                        management, real estate costs, and appropriate performance measurements. The lead-in to his article is worth the
                        read alone:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Companies who adopted technology 20 years ago replaced every company that didn&rsquo;t. Companies who adopt
                            remote working will replace every company who doesn&rsquo;t in 20 years. The reason is incredibly simple:
                            talent and efficiency.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Remote work represents a seismic shift for many companies.</p>

                    <p>
                        We need to start by understanding the culture change that this requires. Most of the world still sees
                        "productivity" as hours in a seat at an office. Productivity and accomplishments are measured by hours
                        on a time card or number of tickets completed. This is that whole misconception of measuring value based on
                        outputs instead of outcomes. In information technology (IT), personnel were largely seen as an expense. IT was a
                        service to be bought, and in order to keep those IT people in line, businesses worked off of a
                        contractor-control model, which often resulted in large project plans, volumes of business
                        "requirements," and the lovely (and always wrong) Gantt chart.</p>

                    <p>
                        Despite Agile and Lean DevOps movements being largely successful and changing the nature of software
                        development, its unfortunate that many businesses still see IT as a service rather than a part of the business.
                        This often bubbles up through measurement of success, which drives us back towards outputs instead of outcomes,
                        and means its more likely that someone is evaluating your productivity according to the chair you're sitting
                        in instead of the work that you're doing.</p>

                    <p>
                        Now that's IT, which by any shape of the argument is fully capable of working from home. Imagine what
                        leadership must think about other parts of the business that are less IT-oriented?</p>

                    <p>
                        Our business culture&mdash;even in the technology industry&mdash;is still largely tied to in-person interactions
                        as a measure of <em>getting things done</em>, which makes the shift to a remote work paradigm increasingly
                        difficult.</p>

                    <p>
                        The cultural change is the hardest, and the behavior change can be just as hard. But before we get to that,
                        let's take a look as some of the immediate changes we can implement to be more remote-ready.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Remote Work Processes</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        I wrote <a href="https://codepunk.io/going-remote-even-for-the-experienced/">a post</a> a few weeks ago about
                        how you can immediately kick-start a better remote work process. It focused on documentation, communication
                        planning, and tools.</p>

                    <p>
                        Transitioning to a remote work environment requires asynchronous communication. People can't wait for
                        answers. If you need to have a question answered, you're going to have to ask it and move on (awaiting a
                        response whenever it comes). If you're constantly queuing up questions, you'll be in a holding pattern.
                        Documentation is the key to solving this, but not in the way you normally look at documentation. We need an
                        open, centralized documentation for processes, values, and expectations that can encompass how a company works
                        and what that company stands for.</p>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook">GitLab has a handbook</a> available online, and considers themselves
                        a handbook-first company. What does that mean? It means that they try very had to make sure the document is
                        up-to-date. Documentation-first or handbook-first means that if you have a question, you should consult the
                        handbook (or manual), and if it's not in the handbook, you collaboratively work on finding the answer with
                        team members, and then you update the handbook as you go. A documentation-first company strives to ensure
                        up-to-date documentation so that answers to potentially repeated questions are always available.</p>

                    <p>
                        Now, this is not some giant Word document or PDF. You would want this centralized documentation to be online and
                        fully available for immediate updates. Some might use a wiki. My company takes a page from GitLab's handbook
                        (see what I did there?), and puts our department's manual in version control as markdown files. Every person
                        has access to the manual through GitHub, and can fork the documentation, edit it, and submit pull requests. This
                        doesn't just mean that the documentation is easily available; It also means that discussions about
                        questions, answers, and changes can be contained to issues and pull requests within the actual repository
                        instead of emails or chat windows&mdash;literally the documentation has it's own form of documentation. To
                        take things a step further, checking in that markdown file can kick off a process that then converts the
                        markdown to HTML, wraps it in a layout and styles, and then publishes it to our production server. Our
                        documentation process has it's own continuous integration and delivery pipeline.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            You could also develop small tooling to surface this in a SharePoint web site or other portal software.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Now this speaks to documentation about processes, but what about on-going activities? This points to
                        communication planning. You can't turn over your shoulder anymore, but also, you shouldn't substitute
                        that in-person meeting with a video call or an email. Start with an informal communication that is asynchronous
                        like chat. Tools such as Microsoft Teams and Slack have changed how many teams collaborate. Use the first when
                        you can. Group chats or channels allow anyone to chime in, providing faster responses and better collaboration,
                        while one-on-one chat helps for decision-making among limited individuals. If you start with this type of
                        asynchronous communication, you can then formalize the discussion in a shared document repository or shared
                        note-taking tool. OneNote is a good example of this (and it integrates with Microsoft Teams). You could also put
                        meeting notes in Box, OneDrive, or DropBox, but I'd save that for collaborative PowerPoint documents or
                        Excel Spreadsheets. Using a loosely formatted note-taking tool where you can copy chats, mark-up, edit,
                        call-out, print emails to, add graphics, etc. lets you brainstorm ideals in a fashion that feels more natural,
                        and if you have to create a formal document later you can. If anything in these notes become official processes,
                        etc., you can add them to the central manual.</p>

                    <p>
                        There are some times when you need to have synchronous communication. When that happens, use a video chat tool,
                        and then document the decisions that came out of the meeting. In general though, try to limit meetings in favor
                        of other forms of communication. Video chats&mdash;especially informal ones&mdash;are going to become more
                        frequent. Let's not let that information get lost because it's going to be harder to reconnect with that
                        person if you forget. They aren't in the next office over anymore.</p>

                    <p>
                        Meetings in general&mdash;and especially video chats as we move towards remote work&mdash;are a time sink, and
                        should be for strategy and synchronous brainstorming, but not for lists, reporting up, or having a meeting just
                        to have a meeting. One of the things I mentioned in my post is that these latter forms of meetings are better
                        suited for official emails; however, I also speak for the need to limit emails. These email communications can
                        be temporal and get lost easily. If it's collaboration you want, use a group chat; If it's a discussion
                        or debate about process, application functionality, etc., use an online source control solution so it goes into
                        the official manual.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Behavior Matters</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        We'll talk a little about tooling later in this issue, but let's come back to behavior for a minute.</p>

                    <p>
                        There are a ton of posts out there in the wild that talk about tricks and tips for working remotely. Some of
                        them are mundane, but important, <a
                            href="https://medium.com/faun/working-from-home-tips-and-tricks-to-increase-productivity-8f590efe02b0">such
                            as keeping a set schedule and paying attention to your eating habits and work/life balance</a>. Other tips
                        revolve around using quality tools.</p>

                    <p>
                        To be successful in a remote work environment requires motivation, diligence, and encoding certain behaviors
                        and habits into your routine. To move to a remote work future, these habits need to be as closely ingrained in
                        our DNA as possible. Keeping a daily task list whether physical or digital (e.g., Microsoft Tasks, Wunderlist)
                        can help. Writing tasks and events down using a method like the <a
                            href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">Bullet Journal Method</a> can also be beneficial. These
                        individual habits of mini-documentation prepare for the remote work need of "document
                        everything"&mdash;the company culture change that might be the hardest.</p>

                    <p>
                        Documentation-first or pull-base teams promote a learning culture where everybody is constantly learning from
                        each other while building out solutions to everyday problems. One of the concepts of creating a learning culture
                        at work is to "<a href="https://medium.com/weseek/work-learn-out-loud-bf86dda1cb3c">work out
                            loud</a>," but this is harder in a remote environment. Providing a narration of the things that you
                        think/do/say means choosing an appropriate avenue for communication where this narration is available to all and
                        much less temporal than it has been in the past.</p>

                    <p>
                        This documentation is going to be <strong>hard</strong> for many. It's more rigid. It's more formal.
                        It's also necessary. Companies and individuals that thrive in the future of remote work are the ones that
                        adhere to a principle of documentation and communication that enable asynchronous communication&mdash;the birth
                        of the asynchronous enterprise. Those that don't thrive will fail.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Remote Today</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Working remotely isn't new. Again, it's just not evenly distributed. There are many teams and companies
                        that are highly successful because of their internal company culture. Two companies I've mentioned in this
                        issue have been largely successful working remotely: GitLab and GitHub. GitLab is 100% remote and has employees
                        across the world. GitHub is about 60-70% remote.</p>

                    <p>
                        What is the secret?</p>

                    <p>
                        Remember when I talked about limiting meetings and promoting asynchronous communications? Just like a programmer
                        that struggles at first with understanding asynchronous functionality, companies will first struggle with
                        asynchronous communications and workflows, but mastering them, while limiting unnecessarily gathering everyone
                        in a single place for a meeting is paramount.</p>

                    <p>
                        The most successful companies limit chit-chat emails and text messages. No, "hey, what's ups" in
                        their communication structure. <a
                            href="https://haacked.com/archive/2020/03/09/geographically-distributed-teams/">Phil Haack points out</a>:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            I mentioned the importance of communicating often. I went so far as to say you should over-communicate. But
                            when you do, respect the the time and attention of your audience.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Haack refers to this as noise. It's unnecessary communication that clutters inboxes and chat windows and
                        potentially breaks the concentration of the person on the other end. Communication must be purposeful.</p>

                    <p>
                        Asynchronous communication and workflows require employees to be enabled, but decisions to be clear. When a
                        discussion is occurring:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow time for feedback</li>
                        <li>Clearly identify those who are the final decision-makers</li>
                        <li>Finalize decisions with a summary and officially document it</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        GitHub, GitLab, and countless other tech companies are able to effectively work remotely by embracing the
                        empowerment of their team members, but also striving for parallelism in their workflows.</p>

                    <p>
                        If documenting everything is a difficult behavioral change, working asynchronously is even harder to adapt to.
                        It's less a culture change and more a paradigm shift. Consider this quote from <a
                            href="https://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/my-long-distance-relationship-with-github/">Sophie
                            DeBenedetto</a>:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            The switch from "in-person" to "remote" wasn't the hard part. Instead, it was the
                            switch from "synchronous" to "asynchronous".</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        This is where transitioning companies often falter. If you're stuck at home right now because of the
                        pandemic, you're likely embroiled in "Zoom Doom" or a slew of "Hey are you there" chat
                        messages, while being bombarded with emails.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is why documentation is so important. Documentation-first companies naturally transition to a
                        <em>writing</em>-heavy organization, and writing things down is a key enabler of asynchronous work for a variety
                        of reasons:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A central manual or handbook means self-service and easy searching</li>
                        <li>Pull-based communications mean responding when you can and receiving responses when available</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        More so than chat conversations, projects or operations that use an issues log, digital Kanban board that allows
                        comments, or coding via pull requests keep the discussion inside of your process where well-written descriptions
                        for clarity lend itself to asynchronous communication and work. The benefits are that being forced to write
                        effectively in order to work asynchronously makes you a better communicator and a better learner.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Remote Tomorrow (with Tools)</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        There are several themes you can pull out of this issue so far:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most companies are still adverse to remove work</li>
                        <li>Technology companies are better at remote work than others</li>
                        <li>Meetings are terrible</li>
                        <li>Write it down; Write it down; Write it down</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        It sounds like a broken record, but this is the state of remote work today. The Internet has enabled us to stay
                        connected despite geographical distances, but we're still only scratching the surface of the paradigm shift
                        needed to go fully remote and be truly effective at it&mdash;especially for non-tech companies. How can we
                        enable today, while preparing for tomorrow?</p>

                    <p>
                        First, let's look at it from a tools perspective.</p>

                    <p>
                        Uninstall Zoom. Look, I know it's becoming the golden child of video conferencing, and my company uses it
                        quite frequently, but <a href="https://twitter.com/szul">if you follow me on Twitter</a>, I probably have been
                        tweeting out about 3-4 articles per week on the security holes in Zoom. I'm not saying other applications
                        don't also have holes, but as we move further into remote work, telemedicine, and other sensitive areas,
                        security is going to be paramount to success and comfort.</p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond video conferencing, we don't hear much about other collaborative software, tools, and automation. We
                        <em>have</em> seen a seismic shift towards SaaS applications, online tools, and collaborative office software
                        (e.g., Google Docs, Office Online), but these tools have mostly enabled productivity through connectedness, and
                        have not shifted the way in which we collaborate&mdash;it hasn't necessarily enabled asynchronous workflows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is again where the technology industry gives us a glimpse into the future. Automated workflows and Lean
                        DevOps allow us to create pipelines for streamlining similar tasks. In <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=accelerate&amp;qid=1586949908&amp;sr=8-2">Accelerate</a>,
                        Nicole Forsgren mentions that the number one predictor of IT performance in their calculated sub-metrics was
                        keeping things in source control, but not necessarily software. The key? Hardware builds, configurations, and
                        other "infrastructure as code" was more important&mdash;keeping systems the same. Configuration
                        management systems like Puppet and Chef help enable that, while the scripts produced to feed these systems can
                        be added to source control, allowing you to duplicate or rollback changes to systems at will.</p>

                    <p>
                        Modern tools give us the ability not just to ensure that servers are aligned, but desktops as well. This goes
                        beyond just imaging a hard disk. For example, a modern pipeline of Vagrant virtual images and Boxstarter (a
                        PowerShell scripting utility that allows you to change Windows configurations, install software, etc.) can
                        ensure that each development machine is not just configured the same and with the same software, but contains
                        the necessary customization for each individual person.</p>

                    <p>
                        Much of this is enabled by the backbone of the Cloud. We used to worry about hardware. Then we worried about
                        virtual machines. Now we just have services in the Cloud that enable our businesses and processes. Much of the
                        SaaS software, package management solutions, and other utilities have succeeded by taking full advantage of the
                        Cloud, and their successes are just the beginning.</p>

                    <p>
                        For example, Visual Studio Live Share might be one of the most impressive uses of Cloud-enabled software yet
                        developed. Imagine being able to pair-program in real-time within the same files, while sharing debug ports,
                        terminals, and other development tools. In Visual Studio Live Share, one can start a debug session, while
                        another can advance the debugger. It's truly an impressive piece of collaborative software. In an
                        asynchronous workforce, the moment when we need to work in tandem become even more important. Visual Studio Live
                        Share shows how we can collaborate on the same files in the same application using the same machine's port
                        regardless of geography. When Visual Studio Live Share first came out, <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7w0uGmQEc8&amp;list=PLz6hh7iUxR23USpo_4ebi5qTgG4te88gP&amp;index=2&amp;t=5s">I
                            tested it out with a co-worker on the other side of the world</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        When I think about something like Visual Studio Live Share, I wonder how much further it could be taken. I
                        remember when thin clients were a popular idea, and I have to think that with shared experiences now being torn
                        apart and shared at the port, file, and byte level, how far before every machine is capable of a fully
                        controlled shared desktop experience&mdash;a blended desktop experience with some files and applications shared
                        among team members for synchronous work despite an asynchronous workflow. Imagine the Visual Studio Live Share
                        experience, but in every single application, if needed.</p>

                    <p>
                        Of course, any discussion of the future of anything has to take into account virtual reality and augmented
                        reality. Headsets like Oculus are a little too bulky for 8 hour workdays, but Google Glass showed us that thin,
                        comfortable wearables are possible. Chat windows and video conferencing can be disruptive to a person's
                        workflow as you switch between applications, but nobody wants to actually pick up a phone call either. With
                        something as small as Google Glass, but as powerful as Oculus, an augmented reality environment can make the
                        video calls and provide contextual information about the linear nature of your work while you continue in an
                        asynchronous workflow. Your in-person work environment isn't just your computer. When you move to remote
                        working arrangements, you are then tied to the laptop as the work experience. Augmented reality innovation can
                        help blend that remote arrangement with the visual and contextual components of what makes many work
                        environments unique. If this ever branches out into virtual reality, we could have a fully immersive work
                        experience despite geographical distance.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>What the Economy Looks Like</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        It's easy to talk about how this could all affect the technology industry. The tech industry is the most
                        "futuristic" in terms of utilizing technology for means of communication, innovation, and
                        collaboration. We're used to acquiring tools and making them work for us.</p>

                    <p>
                        But what about the rest of the world? I forget who originated it, but I'm fond of saying that every job is
                        an IT job and every company is an IT company. The rest of the world will slowly follow suit as IT tries to lead
                        the way. This includes not just work, but also education.</p>

                    <p>
                        The future of work outside of IT looks like it did within IT only with user experiences that create less
                        friction. The IT crowd are the early adopters of asynchronous enterprise work.</p>

                    <p>
                        We also exist at an interesting point in history where artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is fast
                        changing the type of work available to the average person. And gig work that is meant for supplemental income or
                        traveling nomads has forced us to rethink how we handle benefits. The pandemic, meanwhile, has brought universal
                        basic income (UBI) and universal healthcare back into the discussion when it looked like it might have faded
                        with the last campaign of far-left progressives.</p>

                    <p>
                        James Whittaker has been famously extolling the values of AI, data, and virtual reality in talks across the
                        globe. His conclusion? <a href="https://botsandbeer.com/issues/0x09-the-future-of-everything-is-data">The future
                            is data</a>. But what all these "tools" do more than anything is empower those that can use the
                        tools. <a
                            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/03/04/the-future-of-work-is-the-liquid-workforce/">Forbes
                            thinks this enabled a "liquid workforce"</a> in the marketplace:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            What brings this all together is the idea that the future of work is the liquid workforce&mdash;a diverse,
                            robust economy where more and more workers go back to being self-employed, where we go back to our roots as
                            an entrepreneurial nation.</p>

                        <p>
                            Where the corporation was once the structure driving our economy, the future is an agile,
                            technology-enabled, human-optimized and inclusive system. The individuals who comprise the liquid workforce
                            will work anywhere, anytime on projects with varying duration. This idea encompasses the changing policies,
                            mindsets and strategies of the future of work, and more importantly, the opportunities that follow.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        This conclusion pulls from a few trends, but mainly focuses on the continued dream of being an entrepreneur.
                        Forbes speaks to the virtues of self-employment as an exercise in freedom and embraces the same thought
                        experiments that caused the rise of the gig economy. They correctly surmise that with the growing technological
                        ability to work from anywhere&mdash;and the continued shortage of quality engineering applicants&mdash;that
                        employers will be forced to compete with each other for talent via flexible work schedules and remote work
                        offerings. This will flatten the workforce. Companies outside of Silicon Valley must compete by offering
                        competitive pay <em>and</em> work arrangements. We already see this in tech, but we'll soon see it in other
                        industries.</p>

                    <p>
                        This so-called liquid workflow will be further empowered if initiatives that separate healthcare from employment
                        benefits take hold, and some form of a safety net like UBI is installed.</p>

                    <p>
                        As I previously mentioned, the move to an asynchronous enterprise is not just a culture change, it's a
                        paradigm shift. It has been a hard enough adjustment for many in the tech industry, so how can the rest of the
                        world cope?</p>

                    <p>
                        Taking a cue from education, enterprises can start by <a
                            href="https://qz.com/work/1551999/the-benefits-of-flipped-workplaces-include-protection-from-ai/">embracing
                            a flipped workplace</a>. The flipped classroom gave us a style of education that sought to empower learners,
                        while saving in-class time for collaboration and effective answers:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Instead of listening to lectures in class and doing homework at home, flipped learners watch lectures and
                            read at home and then use class time to ask questions and practice applying their learning. Teachers are no
                            longer instructors; they are coaches. Peers are no longer distractions, but collaborators. Students are no
                            longer treated as machines, but as humans, free to learn at their own pace, through active learning and more
                            in accordance with their learning styles.</p>

                            brainstorming, and making unexpected connections. Liberated from enforcement of time-based productivity,
                            managers don&rsquo;t need to be babysitters. Instead they are coaches, enablers, and facilitators focused on
                            unlocking each employee&rsquo;s unique value to the entire organization.</p>

                        Workplaces and offices become more like collaboration spaces or co-working hubs, which is important in places
                        where space is a premium. Such a flipped work environment forces people to be more conscientious of the meetings
                        they schedule, which for non-managerial employees eliminates too much context switching in a given day or week.
                        In fact, you may only need to go to work for meetings&mdash;those that can't be scheduled virtually.</p>

                    <p>
                        Flipped workplaces create a hybrid environment for those companies and industries not ready to embrace a fully
                        asynchronous offering, and it helps to bridge the gap while early adopter technology such as augmented reality
                        starts to catch up. It also gives companies, leadership, and managers the opportunity (and time) to reinvent
                        business processes and standards of practice to better embrace an asynchronous world.</p>

                        I like the name. I like the can. Normally I only drink stouts during the Fall and Winter months, but
                        self-isolation during a pandemic has you lean on your stockpile a little more. This Velvet Walrus is a good
                        choice because the can is a pint can, and at 9.5% ABV it's a nice "winding down" beer after 14-15 hours at a
                        keyboard. It's also a milk stout, so it's much smoother than the imperial stouts you would normally drink in
                        the Winter, and the raspberry infusion lightens up the flavor enough so that it's not too heavy.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is the second raspberry stout that I've found to work well, so there must be something with the tartness
                        of raspberries and the richer stout flavors that blends nicely without the fruit becoming overpowering.</p>
