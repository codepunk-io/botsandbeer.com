                    <p>That's a pretty bold headline, no?</p>
    
                    <p>I have a confession: I don't actually hate Facebook. And I no longer blame Facebook for any of the societal
                        or political upheaval surrounding it. If you follow me on Twitter, you'll likely read me tweeting
                        disparaging comments about Facebook's practices, but is that Facebook? Or is that circumstances?</p>
                
                    <p>I used to believe the former, but I've slowly been shifting to the latter. Zuckerberg certainly has all the
                        characteristics that you'd expect for a person who started Facebook as a "hot or not" for Harvard college
                        kids, but are his awkward displays in front of Congress an indication of his detachment from societal cares,
                        or simply a display of the disconnect between two "tribes?"</p>
                
                    <p>When I think of Facebook, the cringing that I do internally when I think of the Facebook timeline, their data
                        practices, or how political ads run roughshod all over ethics is not the same feeling I get when I look for
                        local events or put on my Oculus.</p>
                
                    <p>I know people who work at Facebook, and I've seen an enthusiastic approach to their work in artificial
                        intelligence, world-building, and community outreach that runs counter to the regular media narratives we
                        hear. Anyone who has read Clive Thompson's <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Making-Tribe-Remaking-World-ebook/dp/B07DBRNN1Z/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1578750902&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Coders:
                                The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World</em></a> should remember the opening story
                        of Facebook engineers developing the news feed; They were caught off-guard by the implications of what they
                        had created, and the downstream side effects. They had good intentions, but had been blinded by the
                        potential negative impacts when a piece of technology built in isolation was loosed upon society.</p>
                
                    <p>The reality? Facebook isn't evil; Advertising and marketing is. <em>I use "evil" there to be "shocking"‚ÄîIt's
                            really more amoral indifference.</em> Marketing and advertising is deeply invested in behavioral
                        manipulation. The father of <a
                            href="https://www.newdesigngroup.ca/blog/short-history-psychology-advertising/">marketing
                            psychology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson">John B. Watson</a>, was made
                        infamous by his 1920's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment">"Little Albert"
                            experiments</a> in which he performed classical conditioning on a baby‚Äîsomething deemed highly unethical
                        by today's standards, and was highly controversial back then. After concluding the Little Albert
                        experiments, Watson eventually joined an advertising agency and used his knowledge of psychology to pioneer
                        a new field of manipulation. He even invented the concept of the "coffee break" to increase sales at Maxwell
                        House.</p>
                
                    <p>Comedian Bill Hicks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0">sums up the world of targeted
                            advertising</a> rather succintly (even if crudely):</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>By the way if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself. It's just a little thought.
                                I'm just trying to plant seeds. Maybe one day they'll take root. I don't know. You try. You do what
                                you can. [...].There's no rationalisation for what you do and you are Satan's little helpers. Okay?
                                Kill yourself. [...] No this is not a joke. You're [going], "There's going to be a joke coming."
                                There's no [...] joke coming. You are Satan's spawn filling the world with bile and garbage. "Ooh,
                                you know what Bill's doing now? He‚Äôs going for the righteous indignation dollar. That's a big
                                dollar. A lot of people are feeling that indignation. We've done research ‚Äì huge market. He's doing
                                a good thing." [...] Quit putting a [...] dollar sign on every [...] thing on this planet. [...] How
                                do you live like that? And I bet you sleep like [...] babies at night, don't you?</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>Yes... I heavily edited that quote.</p>
                
                    <p>Facebook doesn't <em>want</em> to be the John Watson of social media and technology. But our economy's
                        current obsession with growth dictates that any company engaged in advertising is almost required to mine
                        data and manipulate users to increase conversions. Sometimes, data leaks and practices fall in gray areas.
                        We have a tendency to attack the institution rather than the processes that enable the institution. People
                        like to quote Adam Smith on free markets, but most have never read enough of his work to realize that he
                        fully supported government regulation because a corporation should be expected to do whatever needs to be
                        done for shareholder success; The government is required to regulate to ensure the safety of citizens.</p>
                
                    <p>If Facebook is in need of shucking it's bad image, it needs to get away from media and advertising, and focus
                        on the value proposition for its users. How can this be done?</p>
                
                    <p>I don't spend a lot of time on Facebook perusing the feeds. In fact, I often think the timeline is a total
                        waste with minimal value. But there are several areas that provide significant value‚Äîeither to me or to my
                        family members.</p>
                
                    <p>Facebook Events might provide the best overall value and usage of your personal data. We often complain about
                        how much personal data is being taken by Facebook and provided to advertisers, but when I log into Facebook,
                        I'm often presented with local area events based on my interests. Not only is it the easiest way to keep
                        track of local community happenings, but more obscure events like the 20th anniversary of the Matrix or Jake
                        the Snake Roberts on tour have found their way into my timeline: The perfect mixture of local events and
                        events tied to data aggregation. There is no other source of local or customized events online that matches
                        the power that Facebook brings.</p>
                
                    <p>What are some other areas? Well, I'm old, so I still use eBay and Amazon almost exclusively, but my
                        Millennial wife has participated in substantial local transactions (both buying and selling) with Facebook's
                        Marketplace. Again, a global Internet utility is providing significant value for local commerce. This sort
                        of minimal friction transaction allows for item reuse (rather than trashing it), limits shipping
                        transactions, and provides a secondary community market: All factors that are better for local commerce,
                        community engagement, and environmental needs.</p>
                
                    <p>I said minimal friction, but I didn't say frictionless. This is because transactions are still made in person
                        with cash in hand. There is no escrow. There is no credit card payment. How can Facebook make this better,
                        digitize the transaction further, and reduce friction even more? Through payments.</p>
                
                    <p>I hammered Facebook for the the Libra cryptocurrency announcement. I said that the last thing people wanted
                        was the world's least trusted tech company controlling their finances as well. I wasn't the only one that
                        was skeptical, and since its announcement, <a
                            href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-20/facebook-s-failed-libra-starts-2020-facing-fresh-swiss-hurdles">Libra
                            has floundered</a>.</p>
                
                    <p>Facebook wanted a two-pronged approach to Libra as a regulated cryptocurrency backed by a consortium, but
                        that also allowed Facebook to create a local currency in their Calibra wallet for the Facebook ecosystem.
                        Libra was meant to be backed not only by companies such as PayPal, Stripe, and Visa, but also tied to real
                        currencies to limit volatility. Most of these partners have since dropped out, as Facebook continues to be
                        under scrutiny for its data practices.</p>
                
                    <p>Libra itself isn't technically decentralized. Ledger transactions are committed by the Libra Association
                        partners, so in effect, the ledger is decentralized among the partners, but the individual transactions are
                        initially handled by service partners. This offers two things: Control and speed. The former is a cause for
                        concern, but the latter is a positive. The plan is for Libra to move to a proof-of-stake algorithm that
                        would eliminate the slight centralization among members.</p>
                
                    <p>Much like my initial reaction, all reactions to Facebook's Libra have been a knee-jerk reaction based on
                        Facebook's track record with user's personal data, and the large scar of Cambridge Analytica. Nobody "pays"
                        for Facebook, so the large operational costs are covered by marketing and advertising, which puts pressure
                        on targeted marketing algorithms, and makes all data up-for-grabs. Eliminate the Facebook timeline and
                        advertising from the equation, and you have a company with huge equity and ambitions looking to empower
                        microtransactions outside of the control of centralized banking. But more importantly, as commerce becomes
                        more digitized, and technology becomes more prevalent, there is a significant <a
                            href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/counting-the-worlds-unbanked">population
                            underserved by centralized banks</a>.</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>Nearly 2.2 billion financially unserved adults live in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle
                                East.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>This number has fluctuated in its calculation, but <a
                            href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-unbanked-population-in-6-charts-2017-8">trends point to
                            2 or 2.2 billion (down from 2.5 billion) from 2011 to 2014</a>. These "unbanked" don't have access (or
                        the financial capabilities) for modern banking, but are in need of ways to navigate modern technological
                        commerce‚Äîwhether for local transactions, microtransactions, or ecommerce. In fact, in Africa alone,
                        smartphone and Internet access is outpacing banking adoption and government reform, meaning it's citizens
                        have access to modern technology, but little outlet to take advantage. This has been such a problem in
                        modern Africa that <a
                            href="https://decrypt.co/16572/its-official-akon-has-his-own-crypto-city-in-senegal">rapper Akon has
                            invested heavily in building a smart city based on cryptocurrency transactions</a> in order to enable
                        people from his native Senegal, so they can be free from the corruption of the current banking system.</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>"I think that blockchain and crypto could be the savior for Africa in many ways because it brings the
                                power back to the people," [Akon] said on announcing his plans for Akon City. "Cryptocurrency and
                                blockchain technology offer a more secure currency that enables people in Africa to advance
                                themselves independent of the government."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>Cryptocurrency has the ability to enable lower-income individuals in the developed world‚Äîand those without
                        the financial infrastructure in the undeveloped world‚Äîto participate in regular commerce, but also
                        microtransactions and local commerce. We've already seen how smaller payments and investments work with
                        services like <a href="https://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a> that provides crowd-sourced investments to individuals
                        in the developing world. Meanwhile, Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, Kickstarter... these are all companies
                        providing crowd-sourced funds to creatives (partially due to the lack of investment by corporations). The
                        value with crypocurrencies is the ability to "scale down" the transaction, while scaling up the volume:
                        Microtransactions. Microtransactions in cryptocurrencies allow for individuals to develop a portfolio of
                        payments less than the dollar‚Äîsplitting funds as they see fit‚Äîbut on a global participation scale.</p>
                
                    <p>From a media perspective, this could eliminate the power of advertising and marketing, because the
                        individual's engagement is no longer needed for payment. Microtransactions based on viewed content could
                        replace them. I would much rather pay microtransactions (fractions of a cent) to articles read on news sites
                        than get bombarded with ads and have my personal data sold off.</p>
                
                    <p>Outside of media and microtransactions, personal payments such as PayPal's "me" service and Venmo could
                        benefit through microtransaction in communications applications. Facebook is planning Libra integration into
                        Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, but this sort of integration is already in <a
                            href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> using the <a href="https://www.stellar.org">Stellar Network</a>
                        and Lumens cryptocurrency. In fact, Facebook would do itself a favor by looking at Stellar, which uses a
                        consensus model to stay decentralized, is faster than Bitcoin transactions, and allows for tokens anchored
                        to real-world value to limit volatility.</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>Stellar is a multi-currency payment backend that tens of thousands of people use every day. It's
                                decentralized, open-source, and developer-friendly, so anyone can issue assets, settle payments, and
                                trade.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>Stellar has the vision and the technology, but lacks the name recognition and has limited partnerships‚ÄîIBM
                        being one of the few big names experimenting with Stellar. If Libra as an organization is bleeding
                        participants, Facebook could focus its efforts on joining the Stellar Foundation, making both organizations
                        stronger. In the end, what Facebook really wants is for Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp to have the <a
                            href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch">deep payment integration</a> that Keybase and
                        Stellar have developed where you can simply use a shortcut syntax to automatically send money through chat.
                        In Keybase, you can use the following in a group chat:</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>+100XLM@szul</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>Stellar Lumens are worth about 6 cents, so sending 100 isn't much, but that's the point of
                        microtransactions‚Äîa limited payment for quality services. Facebook's vision is a decentralized, but
                        non-volatile microtransaction system, which could serve not just American Facebook users, but the billions
                        of unbanked, providing them with safe transactions.</p>
                
                    <p>With Calibra, meanwhile, Facebook is looking not only to establish a wallet technology, but one where
                        Facebook ecosystem transactions are settled locally. Many see this as Facebook's control mechanism, but done
                        correctly, it's no different than the way the Lightning Network wants to put a transactional layer on top of
                        the Bitcoin blockchain in order to speed transactions. In my previous <a
                            href="https://botsandbeer.com/issues/1x05-the-crypto-promise-of-a-cyberian-paradise">knee-jerk
                            reaction</a> to the Libra news, I said:</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        
                            <p>In many ways, Libra sends a false sense of openness by creating a non-Facebook owned entity to manage
                                the technology, while the Calibra "wallet" essentially creates a cryptocurrency transfer mechanism,
                                but allows Calibra-to-Calibra transfer outside of the Libra blockchain. This parallels (to a certain
                                extent) what the Lightning Network is trying to do with Bitcoin--a transaction layer based on trust
                                that only needs to go to the blockchain when its time to reconcile the balance. The difference is
                                that Facebook wholly owns Calibra, and it's clear that they want to use this to create their own
                                financial ecosystem for their users.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                
                    <p>But again, this is based on my perception of Facebook as a media company. There is not much philosophical
                        difference between Calibra-to-Calibra transactions that only "settle" when moving to Libra, and what the
                        Lightning Network is trying to solve for. Nor is there much difference between these transactions and the
                        "local currency" that has started to become a gold standard talking point for people like <a
                            href="https://rushkoff.com">Douglas Rushkoff</a>. The trade-off is that local currencies and local
                        economies will always have their own governance, while more global standards will require greater consensus.
                        For Facebook, "local" just happens to be their digital ecosystem rather than a city in New Jersey or
                        something. The value for Facebook is that they can take a percentage off the top of each microtransaction
                        for network utilitization. Maybe they're only taking 0.0005 per transaction or per dollar, but at Facebook's
                        reach and scale, that becomes voluminous. It also provides them with an alternative growth market to
                        advertising, which‚Äîas discussed‚Äîhas consistently pushed companies over the edge towards unethical behavior.
                        Yes, Facebook essentially becomes a bank, but does a significant public service by enabling
                        microtransactions, safety, and a place for the world's unbanked. Such a service can be integrated into chat,
                        can provide micro-subscription services to Facebook "Pages" and content producers who can rely on
                        mini-payments instead of advertising, and can provide an escrow for Facebook's Marketplace, which already
                        does a public service by enabling local and secondary markets for neighborhoods.</p>
                
                    <p>If you distrust this scenario (and I'm sure many do), is it because you doubt the people at Facebook, or
                        because you doubt their reputation thanks their current business model? Is it Facebook, or is it the
                        advertising and marketing paradigm?</p>
                
                    <p>Where does Oculus fit in all of this?</p>
                
                    <p>First, Oculus is Facebook's only successful hardware at the moment. The other smart home and IoT hardware is
                        insignificant and untrusted by the public. The Oculus brand is powerful, the hardware is high quality, and
                        putting an Oculus on for the first time is‚Äîdare I say‚Äîa spiritual experience.</p>
                
                    <p>The easy thing to say is that Facebook will take a percentage off the top of transactions inside of Oculus
                        games (as well as games on the Facebook platform).</p>
                
                    <p>Forget about games.</p>
                
                    <p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are going to change the landscape with world-building. The best parts of
                        Oculus aren't hitting blocks with light sabers (although that <em>is</em> fun). The best parts of Oculus are
                        the world-building and the social interaction you bring to those world. And who knows social better than
                        Facebook?</p>
                
                    <p>Facebook has been desperate to shift away from being a one-trick pony with a social media feed. Oculus takes
                        them into the future: Virtual worlds and marketplaces fully-enabled by microtransactions that empower users.
                        With the Facebook Horizon experiment, Facebook gets to test the waters of an open-world virtual environment
                        rife with social interaction. This is a future where Facebook ceases to be a web site that you log into, and
                        is instead the operating system of the virtual reality visor you put on. The world of wearable hardware.</p>
                
                    <p>From an operational and financial perspective, hardware sales and transaction fees diversify Facebook's
                        revenue‚Äîreducing the need for advertising revenue, which reduces the need to satisfy marketing departments.
                        This provides Facebook with the sort of leverage that Google can't seem to acquire. Despite it's many
                        technological advances, 95% of Google's revenue is still from advertising. When we hear about data misuse,
                        notice that we hear about Google and Facebook (advertising-centric companies), but don't actually hear much
                        about Microsoft, IBM, or Apple. Companies with diverse revenue portfolios have greater leverage to align
                        business value with collective organizational value. And if Facebook really does want to be the operating
                        system of the virtual world‚Äîif they really want to enable the unbanked through cryptographic
                        transactions‚Äîthey have to increase the public trust by taking stances on marketing and advertising that
                        protect users. There's no way for them to play both sides of that coin and succeed. To transition to the
                        future, Facebook needs to leave the past behind.</p>

                    <h4 class="row-heading first">Founders KBS Espresso</h4>
                    <p>We've talked about some Founders beer before‚Äîboth Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) and Kentucky Breakfast Stout
                        (KBS) are two of our favorites. This special edition is a coffee and chocolate stout aged in bourbon barrels
                        and laid over espresso beans. It's strong at 12% ABV, and a four pack will run about 20 bucks or more. It's
                        worth the investment. Bear in mind that this isn't the type of beer where I'd recommend sitting down and
                        devouring the entire four pack. That's a recipe for disaster. My recommendation is that this is a finishing
                        beer for when your night is over. Timing is everything for proper enjoyment.</p>
