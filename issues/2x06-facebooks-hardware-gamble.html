                    <p><em>We're trying something new over at the Codepunk YouTube channel. Give a look at <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6hh7iUxR22b8SPV2awhzeLTCuwFJGxE">our first few
                                Digital Shots</a>, and tell us what you think.</em></p>

                    <p>Another Facebook email? No, I'm not a shill for the company. I'm still as skeptical as ever, but recent
                        trends in the industry and at the company point to some signals of a potential transformation. They bear
                        analysis: So let's take a look.</p>

                    <p>Remember the Facebook phone? Me neither. In fact, I was just about to sit down to start writing this email
                        when the thought of it popped into my head. Here I was about to write an email about Facebook's foray into
                        hardware, and I almost forget their first disaster.</p>

                    <p>Much like the Amazon Fire smartphone, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Home">Facebook Home</a>
                        was a solid idea that never took off in the marketplace. In fact, Facebook Home wasn't even hardware. It was
                        a launcher and overlay for the Android operating system‚Äîessentially hijacking the Android operating system
                        and injecting its own brand and apps throughout the device. With Facebook steering the way as the most used
                        social network, and one of the dominant tech giants, why wouldn't they be able to slide through the side
                        door of the smartphone market‚Äîespecially since every application, OS, and other service wants to
                        <strong>integrate</strong> with Facebook to steal social connections.</p>

                    <p><em>I always thought that Amazon missed the boat by not making a Fire MP3 player first. I know people like to
                            say that dedicated MP3 players are dead, but a compact, dedicated device with a long battery life, and
                            easy, mountable, interface still has an appeal to many. Amazon having their own music library, as well
                            as Audible, could have made a unique device for media consumers much like they've been successful with
                            dedicated eReaders despite the emergence of the tablet market... I owned a Zune and a Zune HD though, so
                            take my opinion on dedicated MP3 devices lightly.</em></p>

                    <p>Facebook's phone initiative <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-why-the-facebook-phone-flopped/">failed
                            for many reasons</a>, but a primary reason for it's failure is that a phone <em>centered</em> on
                        Facebook becomes a niche device. Facebook felt the need to dominate the interface when the reality is that
                        people want the utility of the smartphone to be front-and-center, and the integration of social media to be
                        on the periphery. Niche devices in the phone market won't be able to sell enough to cover the costs of
                        hardware and marketing.</p>

                    <p>Facebook's next foray into hardware (outside of their purchase of Oculus) was to launch <a
                            href="https://about.fb.com/technologies/portal/">Facebook Portal</a>‚Äîand the world shook with laughter.
                        Portal came out when Facebook was at its lowest in terms of consumer good will. Questions about data
                        collection, data misuse, and privacy violations were beating at the door of the company, and even people
                        comfortable with Jeff Bezos hearing their deepest, darkest thoughts and converting them to Amazon purchases
                        scoffed at the idea of giving Facebook a microphone and camera in their home.</p>

                    <p>I won't lie; I was one of those people that scoffed.</p>

                    <p>As much as it makes sense for the leading social networking powerhouse to make a move towards connecting
                        people with specialized hardware, Facebook's reputation was always going to prevent it from being
                        successful. Portal was actually the remnants of Facebook's vaunted Building 8 project, which <a
                            href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/facebooks-flop-in-hardware-the-untold-story-of-building-8.html">crash-and-burned
                            quite spectacularly under former Google executive Regina Dugan</a> at a time when Mark Zuckerberg was
                        desperate to get into the hardware game.</p>

                    <p>Why the desperation? I mentioned in a previous issue how Facebook's future needs to be one of a diversified
                        revenue portfolio and not just advertising. Mark Zuckerberg felt the same way when he decided to invest
                        heavily in Building 8.</p>

                    <blockquote>

                            <p>There's a lot of money at stake. The smart home market, which includes speakers and entertainment
                                products, is forecast to reach $151.4 billion in revenue by 2024, up from $76.6 billion last year
                                [...]. The analysis doesn't include Facebook among the more than three-dozen companies listed as
                                potentially key players.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As Building 8 failed, Portal became the sole focus of Facebook's own branded hardware effort, but has
                        struggled for many of the reasons mentioned above:</p>

                    <blockquote>

                            <p>[...] the company continues its effort to develop Portal, it has to contend with a deterioration of
                                trust among consumers following a host of privacy scandals that make it difficult to lure customers
                                into buying a Facebook-branded camera for their living room.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Then the world was turned upside down.</p>

                    <p>COVID-19 put the world on lock down, and Facebook has a good record for using it's people-connecting DNA to
                        promote safety and communication during times of crisis‚Äîeven if it's something as simple as "mark as safe."
                        Now, with everyone confined to some form of self-isolation and travel severely limited, people need to find
                        other avenues of communication. You could use WhatsApp; You could use Skype; You could use a simple phone
                        call... but even people who despise Facebook as a social media news feed likely have it to stay connected to
                        distant family and friends. It's the only way my family in New Jersey can see photos of my children.</p>

                    <p>We all have Facebook, which means we all have Facebook Messenger‚Äîeven if we refuse to download it to our
                        phone. Facebook Messenger is actually the path of least resistance for most, and it didn't take long for the
                        previously scoffed Portal to sell out. Even as I write this issue‚Äîalthough most devices are back in stock
                        and on sale for Mother's Day‚Äîthe Portal TV device is still out of stock.</p>

                    <p>Facebook Portal sales <a
                            href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-portal-is-a-hit-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-thanks-to-your-grandparents/">have
                            risen by 10x and largely have been positively received by end-users</a>. It's actually a nice piece of
                        hardware with a quality aesthetic. It allows for Messenger and WhatsApp video calling, but also integrates
                        with Alexa‚Äîpiggy-backing off of Amazon's services to beef up its utility. Notice something? This is
                        essentially the same game plan as Facebook Home: A specialized layer integrated with existing, popular
                        software. The difference? With Portal, the video chat is central, and Facebook owns that experience. They
                        can use Alexa to fill gaps while they flesh out other services of their own that they can eventually swap
                        out unnoticed. Also, unlike Facebook Home where the Facebook experience usurped the utility of the
                        smartphone, Portal's very utility is centered on what Facebook is best at: Connecting people.</p>

                    <p>Facebook's Portal is so user-friendly that <a
                            href="https://patch.com/new-hampshire/portsmouth-nh/open-letter-parents-facebook">some are even
                            recommending it as a tool to keep children socializing</a> (an important developmental milestone) during
                        the pandemic.</p>

                    <p>I don't want to give Facebook too much credit here. They have a ton of privacy concerns that still need to be
                        addressed, and although they have done admirable with their <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com">Data for
                            Good</a> initiative, there is little to suggest that Portal is doing much more than taking advantage of
                        the pandemic and current market conditions. I'm approaching this from the outside with a business analyst's
                        perspective. The pandemic has allowed Facebook to gain a foothold in the smart home market; It gets to be a
                        gateway drug to other devices and services, and Facebook can position themselves to "recommend" the most
                        compatible devices and services.</p>

                    <p>If I think about the market over the last 5 years, there's one company that I feel Facebook missed the boat
                        on: Ring. Ring has always been explicitly tied to the "neighborhood" as a concept, even if it was simply a
                        doorbell security camera. The branding and the ideology of the company was a "more secure home" in the sense
                        of a community and the normal community-driven activities (like mail). Ring eventually evolved their
                        services to include a Neighbors application, connecting Ring consumers in the same neighborhood for
                        self-policing. I won't comment on if this self-policing is a good or bad thing (we've all read some of the
                        horror stories about discrimination), but this digital community is Facebook's bread-and-butter, and Amazon
                        scooped it up right in front of them. Ring would have not only allowed them to create a digital compliment
                        to <em>real</em> communities, but would have gained them a foothold in the hardware market.</p>

                    <p><em>As a side note: I'm surprised Facebook hasn't gone after <a href="https://nextdoor.com">Nextdoor</a> yet.
                            NextDoor and Walmart recently partnered on a "Neighbors Helping Neighbors" initiative that is right up
                            Facebook's community-driven alley.</em></p>

                    <p>If Facebook missed out on Ring to Amazon, what would be another move they could make? Arlo.</p>

                    <p>Arlo has been <a
                            href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/arlo-technologies-arlo-may-report-negative-earnings%3A-know-the-trend-ahead-of-q1-release">taking
                            a beating in the stock market</a> as sales and revenue have decreased. Previous parent company (and
                        majority shareholder) Netgear <a
                            href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4340090-arlo-can-reattach-to-growth">redistributed their
                            shares</a> to their own shareholders, and <a
                            href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200429005955/en/Arlo-Announces-Executive-Leadership-Streamline-Business-Increase/">changes
                            to executive leadership</a> are afoot. Perfect time for Facebook to make a move.</p>

                    <p>Facebook is in a position to come out of the pandemic with a bit of good will and a tiny slice of
                        market share, but they will not be able to ramp up hardware innovation or production fast enough to take
                        advantage of that good will on there own. They could, however, jump start it with a purchase like Arlo, and
                        if they really wanted to be ambitious, just buy Netgear entirely.</p>

                    <p>Why?</p>

                    <p>The Amazon Echo is not the central hub of your home. Same is true for Google Home or any other personal
                        digital assistant. Your Modem and WiFi router have always been that hub. Your personal network runs off of
                        it. Alexa can't access the world's knowledge without it. If Facebook wants to make a move into hardware,
                        purchasing Arlo and then Nextdoor would be the first step in creating a local digital community to
                        compliment Facebook's global social network, but purchasing Netgear gives them control of the hub of your
                        digital life.</p>

                    <p>Netgear <a
                            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2020/04/26/netgear-orbi-wifi-6-ax6000-rbk852-review-best-mesh-router-recommended-office-home-wifi/#778b71dc1bbc">already
                            boasts the best mesh network in the industry</a>, and they have over 25 years of experience in
                        developing quality hardware. As the parent company of Arlo, that experience shows in Arlo's own devices.
                        Facebook's Portal shows that the average home owner wants simplicity. If you want a decked out smart home,
                        and decide on SmartThings, you need a hub (or two), and you have to connect that to your router. If you want
                        to be able to control your smart home with Google Home or Amazon's Alexa, you need to buy an additional
                        device and hook it to your router. Just something as simple as a smart light bulb (Philips Hue requires a hub)
                        or a door sensor that you want to control with your voice requires multiple hubs. This isn't simple.</p>

                    <p>Through going all in on a purchase like Netgear (and Arlo) Facebook can streamline the hub, slowly
                        integrating simplicity (and voice control) into WiFi routers and mesh extenders. Facebook's Portal already
                        works with Alexa, so again, they can integrate for functionality, while pealing off services and replacing
                        them with their own as they go.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>With Netgear, they would have a solid hardware partner that can get them in the homes of
                                millions of users</li>
                        <li>With Arlo, they would have a smart security setup that could rival Ring</li>
                        <li>With Portal, they have a simple flagship smart home component with a built-in user base
                                thanks to Messenger</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you combine this with a Nextdoor-like application or purchase, Facebook is then positioned to own three
                        spheres of community:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The global social network</li>
                        <li>The <em>local</em> digital community</li>
                        <li>The virtual meta layer (via Oculus)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I remember a long while back when Foursquare (remember Foursquare?) was attempting to market themselves as
                        the location layer of the Internet. Thinking of the Internet (and digital space) in multiple layers makes
                        sense. Facebook already owns the social layer of the Internet: How people communicate and share information
                        online. With the local digital community, Facebook can better integrate tools like Facebook Events and
                        Marketplace with local community-specific functionality available in applications like Neighbors and
                        Nextdoor. This is essentially enabling a data layer on top of the community in a manner more driven towards
                        physical location than global communication. Finally, with Oculus and Facebook Horizon, Facebook can begin
                        experimenting with world-building in virtual reality, but expect Oculus to begin tackling both VR
                        <em>and</em> augmented reality (AR) when the hardware is small enough for everyday use. AR gives us the
                        option of an added layer of reality that we only glimpsed with Google Glass. Magic Leap wants desperately to
                        own this space (they've dubbed it the Magic-verse), but they've struggled financially. In Oculus, Facebook
                        has the best VR device on the planet, and they are positioned both financially and technologically to capture
                        and build that meta-verse layer.</p>

                    <p>If Facebook's endgame is to diversify their revenue to move away from their reliance on advertising, and they
                        are serious about getting in deep in the hardware game, it would be a missed opportunity not to accelerate
                        in the face of this pandemic to build from the solid reviews and goodwill that Facebook Portal has provided
                        them.</p>
                        
                    <p class="center"><img src="/static/images/2x06-02.jpg" alt="Wicked Weed Funkatorium" title="Wicked Weed Funkatorium" /></p>
                    <h4 class="row-heading first">Wicked Weed Funkatorium</h4>

                    <p>This was something unexpected. I'm a huge fan of sour beer, and this Wicked Weed entry is a bouron
                        barrel-aged sour fermented with blackberries and dates. It's sweet, sour, and muted‚Äî<em>so</em> hard to
                        describe. The sour is potent, but the bourbon-aging gives you enough mouthfeel to prevent the sour from
                        being puckering. Reducing the potency of the blackberries with the dates turns the sourness a little
                        sweeter. The flavor-blending is phenomenal, and at 10% ABV, this is a strong beer.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6VGKiN0ArE">I poured this into a glass</a> while listening to <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMcWPM9eOz9Dsn7YwAlpOoQ">Rezz</a> and programming on a Friday
                        night. It had a cork in it. Fancy.</p>

                    <p>This is currently my favorite sour beer of all time.</p>
